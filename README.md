# Exploratory work on DEEPDIP project

This repo contains scripts that we develop with the purpose of exploring elements around DEEPDIP such as:
- Packages
- Techniques
- Workflows
- APIs

## For developers
Let's try to keep this repo tidy by creating folders for similar explorations that have in common dependencies. 
in this way, we can have several julia projects and environments that do not take that long to set-up instead of having a single big project with all dependencies.
